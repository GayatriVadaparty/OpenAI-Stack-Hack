This project is a part of the OpenAI Hackthon Feb 2023. This 7-day virtual hackathon made students to Create innovative new apps with OpenAI's latest AI tools.

##GPT-3
GPT-3 is a powerful AI technology that provides the foundation for the next generation of apps. It operates by taking a text prompt such as a phrase or sentence and returning a natural language text completion. This allows developers to easily program GPT-3 by showing it a few examples, and the system will learn to generate text that is similar to the examples provided. 

##Whisper
Whisper is a cutting-edge AI technology that excels at recognizing words from web-sourced data. Trained on 680,000+ hours of multilingual and multitask data, it can accurately recognize speech in various languages, accents, and environments, including different accents, technical language and background noise. Whisper can achieve human-level performance in many scenarios.

##ChatGPT
ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT-3 language model that is specifically designed for generating human-like text in a conversational setting. It has been trained on a large dataset of real-life conversations and can generate responses that are appropriate and relevant in context. We will show you how to use ChatGPT effectively and how it can benefit your project.

###Powerful Models
GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 (Also popularly known as ChatGPT)  trained their models on billions of words to understand the nuances and context markers of human communication.

###Flexible API
The API works with many different libraries that fit every stack. Cohere's Python, Node, and Go SDKs make AI easy to integrate into your app.

###The Future of software
Build innovative and extremely powerful applications that were previously not possible. The future of software development is AI native.
